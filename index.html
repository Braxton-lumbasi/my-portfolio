                <img src="Assets/smart.jpg" alt="smart irrigation" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"> 
                <p>A smart irrigation farm system with Node MCU utilizes sensors to monitor soil moisture levels and weather conditions. Based on this data, the Node MCU microcontroller controls water pumps to irrigate crops only when necessary, optimizing water usage and crop health. This system can be remotely managed via a mobile app or web interface, offering farmers real-time insights and control over irrigation operations.</P>
